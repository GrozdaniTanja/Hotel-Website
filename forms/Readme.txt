# Hotel Grozdani Project

**Author:** Tanja Grozdani

## Project Description
Hotel Grozdani is a web-based hotel management system designed to streamline and automate various hotel operations. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing hotel reservations, room availability, customer information, and other related tasks. This readme file provides an overview of the project, its components, and important information for developers and users.

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap: The project utilizes the Bootstrap framework for its design and responsive layout. The design elements and styles provided by Bootstrap help create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

- PHP: The backend of the project is developed using PHP, a server-side scripting language. PHP enables dynamic content generation and interacts with the database to process user requests and perform necessary operations.

- SQL Database: Hotel Grozdani employs an SQL database to store and manage data such as room details, customer information, and reservations. The database is accessed and manipulated using SQL queries through PHP.

- Booking System: The project incorporates a robust booking system, allowing users make reservations. The system ensures that reservations are handled efficiently and accurately.

- PHPMailer: Hotel Grozdani utilizes PHPMailer, a popular PHP library, to handle email notifications. PHPMailer enables the system to send automated emails to customers for booking confirmations, reminders, and other communication.

- jQuery and Ajax: The project integrates jQuery, a JavaScript library, and Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to enhance user experience and improve the responsiveness of the system. These technologies enable dynamic content updates without requiring a full page reload.
